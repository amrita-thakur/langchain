# RAG Applications with LangChain

This repository contains code for Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) applications developed using LangChain. RAG combines the benefits of generative models with retrieval-based methods to enhance the quality and relevance of generated text.

## Overview

LangChain is a framework that integrates retrieval and generation models seamlessly, allowing for flexible and efficient development of RAG applications. This repository serves as a collection of projects and experiments leveraging LangChain for various text generation tasks.

## Features

- Integration of retrieval models with generative models using LangChain.
- Sample applications demonstrating RAG capabilities for different domains (e.g., healthcare, customer service).
- Experimentation with different retrieval strategies and model architectures.
- Documentation and examples to facilitate understanding and usage of RAG in LangChain.
